# ip_explorer
A package to help facilitate analyzing the effects of architectural changes on the trainability, representation capacity, and data efficiency of an interatomic potential.

This package builds heavily upon the following packages:

* [pytorch_lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/): for distributed model evaluation
* [loss-landscapes](https://github.com/marcellodebernardi/loss-landscapes): for generating loss landscapes
* [SHEAP](https://bitbucket.org/bshires/sheap/src/master/): for generating potential energy surfaces

## Visuals
TODO: add example loss landscapes and SHEAP plots

## Installation
`git clone https://lc.llnl.gov/gitlab/vita1/ip_explorer.git`
`pip install -e . `

## Usage
TODO: update this once more `scripts/` are ready
TODO: show how to add support for a new model
